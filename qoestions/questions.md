“Student” class
iv. A method called “calculate ()” which does not take any parameter and returns void. This
method contains statements to calculate the percentage of marks for each object of “Student”
class using formula:
Percentage of marks=(total marks/500)*100
This method also contains statements to display the calculated values of percentage of marks
Now write a program in Java to import these two packages and create three records of each of Student and
Employee class and display each of them using Menu
43. Write an own Exception class called “MyException” and write another class called “Bank” with
a) Instance variables account_No, customer_name and balance_amount
b) A constructor called “Bank ()” which contains statements to take inputs from the keyboard and set
values of the instance variables of each object of “Bank” class
c) A method called “display ()” to display the values of instance variables of each object of “Bank” class
Now write another class called “BankRecord” which contains main () method. Inside the main () method
write statements to display a message that “A Bank File is Opened”, at the beginning. After that write
statements to create and display 3 different Bank records for 3 customers of the Bank class. After display of
the 3 records, display a message that “The Opened File is Closed”. Write all necessary codes to avoid all
possible exceptions (use all the five keywords “try”, “catch”, “throw””, “throws” and “finally”)
Take balance amount< Rs. 500 as condition to create Exception (i.e. Exception condition)

57. Write a program in Java to create a generic class “Student” and display three different student records
58. Write a program in Java to design a class “Employee” that contains a generic method. Now write another class
“EmployeeRecord” (which contain main() method) to display three different Employee records using the
generic method
59. Write a program in Java to create a generic interface “Record” and a generic implementation class
“AnyRecord”. Now create another class “StoreRecord” to create and display one Employee record and one
Student record
60. Write an applet to create a form containing a Text Field for receiving the name of the user, a Text Area to
receive the address, a list box to receive the user selected items and two Push Buttons ‘OK’ and ‘Cancel’ at the
bottom of the form and again displayed in the Text area. When the Cancel button in the form is clicked, the
data typed in the form will be cleared
61. Write a Java program to pass name and salary to an Applet and get the Tax calculated
Page 11 of 11
62. Write an applet to play a .wav audio file
63. Write a program in Java to create graphical user interfaces
a) To store
b) To retrieve

64. Write a program in Java to create graphical user interfaces
a) To store
b) To retrieve
an Employee record using Database MySQL (use JDBC-ODBC Driver)
65. Define a class named “Temperature”. The class has two accessors —toFahrenheit and toCelsius—that return
the temperature in the specified unit and two mutators —setFahrenheit and setCelsius—that assign the
temperature in the specified unit.
Now write a new class “TemperatureTest” containing the main () method. Inside the main () method write a
Menu-Driven program that inputs temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and outputs the temperature in
equivalent degrees Celsius and vice-versa
66. Write a program in Java to build a Digital Clock(using swing)
67. Write a program to create an applet with 3 Buttons ( Red, Green, Blue) and Text Box, When a particular
button is clicked the text colour of text box also changed to corresponding colour

alignments of texts in editor (using applet)
69. Write a program to create an applet with a List Box with colours (Red, Blue, Green) and when a particular list
is selected, the background of the applet changes to the colour selected from the List Box
70. Write a Menu-Driven program in Java to
i. To insert student record
ii. To view the students’ record
iii. To update the marks of a particular student
iv. To delete a particular record of a student
